"# Rust-counter" 

A Text based counter toy-app to explore the features of the Rust language.
Testing out building workspaces,  matching, enums, results, option types, structures, and struct implementations.
tried out some crates:
    serde: for serializing and deserializing Rust data structures
    and looking into clearscreen for keeping the terminal cleaner looking.
